# Funding Trends Tests

This document contains test scenarios and results for the funding_trends.sh script, which provides trend analysis for donations and funding.

## Purpose

The funding_trends.sh script extends the existing funding analytics capabilities with:
1. Monthly trend analysis of donations
2. Prediction of future funding based on historical data
3. Detailed analysis of donation sources and distributions
4. Comprehensive trend reporting with visualizations

These capabilities help the lifeform make data-driven decisions about funding strategies and track progress toward sustainability.

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Monthly Trend Analysis

**Purpose:** Verify that the script can analyze and display monthly donation trends.

**Steps:**
1. Ensure donation data exists in the tracking file
2. Run `./modules/funding/funding_trends.sh monthly`
3. Verify that monthly aggregation and visualization are displayed

**Expected Results:**
- Script should aggregate donations by month
- A table showing monthly totals should be displayed
- A visualization of trends should be shown using ASCII charts

**Actual Results:**
- ✅ Script successfully aggregated donations by month
- ✅ Monthly trend table was properly formatted
- ✅ ASCII visualization showed relative donation amounts per month
- ✅ Error handling worked correctly when no donation data was available

### Test 2: Funding Prediction

**Purpose:** Test the ability to predict future funding based on historical patterns.

**Steps:**
1. Run `./modules/funding/funding_trends.sh predict 6`
2. Observe the predictions for the next 6 months

**Expected Results:**
- Script should calculate a monthly average from existing data
- Predictions for the specified number of months should be displayed
- Cumulative totals should be calculated correctly

**Actual Results:**
- ✅ Monthly average was correctly calculated from historical data
- ✅ Predictions for the next 6 months were displayed in a clear table
- ✅ Cumulative totals were calculated and formatted correctly
- ✅ Script handled the case of insufficient data appropriately

### Test 3: Donation Source Analysis

**Purpose:** Test analysis of donation distribution across different platforms.

**Steps:**
1. Run `./modules/funding/funding_trends.sh sources`
2. Check the breakdown of donations by platform

**Expected Results:**
- Statistics for each platform should be displayed (total, percentage, count, average)
- A visualization should show the relative contribution of each platform
- Percentages should add up to 100%

**Actual Results:**
- ✅ Platform statistics were calculated correctly
- ✅ Percentage distribution was accurate
- ✅ ASCII visualization clearly showed the relative contribution
- ✅ Average donation calculations were correct
- ✅ Edge cases (zero donations) were handled gracefully

### Test 4: Comprehensive Trend Report

**Purpose:** Test generation of a complete funding trends report.

**Steps:**
1. Run `./modules/funding/funding_trends.sh report`
2. Review the generated report file

**Expected Results:**
- A Markdown report should be generated in the logs directory
- The report should include all analysis sections (overview, sources, monthly trends, predictions)
- Visualizations and tables should be properly formatted for Markdown

**Actual Results:**
- ✅ Report was generated in the correct location
- ✅ All analysis sections were included with proper formatting
- ✅ Tables were correctly formatted for Markdown
- ✅ Data was consistent between different analysis sections
- ✅ Recommendations were provided based on the analysis
- ✅ Error handling for missing jq was implemented

## Integration with Existing Funding Systems

The funding_trends.sh script integrates with:
1. The existing funding analytics system (funding_analytics.sh)
2. The donation tracking JSON structure
3. The funding reporting system

The script provides trend analysis without modifying the core functionality of these systems, adhering to the principle of minimizing complexity in the codebase.

## Dependencies and Requirements

The script depends on:
1. jq for JSON processing (provides a graceful fallback with limited functionality if not available)
2. awk for numerical calculations
3. Existing donation tracking file (created by funding_analytics.sh if not present)

## Conclusion

The funding_trends.sh script successfully extends the funding analytics capabilities with trend analysis, prediction, and visualization features. The tests confirm that it works correctly with the existing donation data structure and provides valuable insights for funding strategy development.

These enhancements support the strategic task S004 (Explore Self-Sufficiency Mechanisms) by providing deeper analysis of funding patterns and helping the lifeform make data-driven decisions about funding approaches.
